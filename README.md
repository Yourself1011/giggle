<h1 align="center">Giggle</h1>

<p align="center">The world's #1.35 search engine, or something</p>

A rudimentary search engine and web crawler made from scratch. Uses [tfidf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) and [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), similar to the very first iteration of Google. It currently contains 50 000 pages, and takes up 5GB. In comparison, Google has around 400 billion pages, and the English Wikipedia alone contains 6 million articles, taking up 22GB compressed, so results from Giggle are generally much worse than leading search engines. For certain topics, however, it performs reasonably well, and you can give it a shot at <https://giggle.danielzh.dev/> (note: sometimes my database provider pauses my instance if unused for a while).
